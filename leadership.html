        <h1>Girls Who Code</h1>
        <p> I have been a part of Girls Who Code since September 2018, first as a general member and later
            as the social chair. As a chair, I aid in running the University of Michigan branch of Girls Who Code, 
            the college-level organization for Girls Who code aimed at supporting and increasing the number of 
            women in tech fields. We accomplish this through hosting coding 
            workshops and social events for general member and community outreach programs for high school aged
            students in the area.

        <h1>Global Scholars Program</h1>
        <p>
            I have been a part of the Global Scholars Program since August 2018, first as a intern and now
            as a facilitator. As a collaborative group facilitator, I lead a group of underclassmen 
            to help them complete an internship with an international organization. I facilitate their development
            of professional skills as well as a better understanding of global social justice, helping them learn how
            to incorporate invaluable lessons of intercultural interaction into their everyday lives.

        <h1>University Unions League Board of Governors</h1>
        <p>
            I have been a part of the Global Scholars Program since September 2018, first as a general board member and now
            as the chair. As the chair, I lead a group of students, staff, and alumni to discuss and reach consensus 
            about decisions regarding a historical university union, including renovations, policy change, and 
            scholarship distribution. My day to day tasks include collaborating to create meeting agendas, arranging presenters
            for monthly meetings, and keeping meeting discussions on track.
