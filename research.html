        <h1>Sport Analytics</h1>
        <p>Since August 2019, I've worked with a faculty advisor and training/coaching personnel in UM Athletics to address a 
            set of analyses related to athlete health, safety, and performance using data gathered from tracking devices worn in 
            practice and competition by the University of Michigan Field Hockey team. I condense findings to concise, easy-to-comprehend 
            graphics and report out findings and recommendations to a diverse audience including coaches, trainers, and players. This year,
            I had the opportunity to attend the 2020 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. There, I was able to meet fellow researchers
            in the sports analytics realm to compare research strategies and learn more able the future of the field.

        <h1>School for Environment and Sustainability</h1>
        <p>
            I worked as a research assistant in the School for Environment and Sustainbility from September 2017 to August 2019.
            During my time in this lab, I studied the livelihood and climate adaptation strategies of Indian farmers, catalogued
             qualitative data gathered from household surveys with OpenRefine, and modeled variables and analyzed their relationships using R software.
             I was able to take the lead on R analysis in this lab and report out findings at several nationwide conferences.
        </p>

        <h1>LivWell App</h1>
        <p>
            I worked as an app developer for the LivWell App from May 2018 to August 2018. 
            More specifically, my role was coding a spatial analysis tab using R Shiny App packages to allow various researchers and organizations 
            to visually analyze the impact of their forest development efforts. This project allowed me to work both independently and collaborate and 
            communicate as part of an international team.
